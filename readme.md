# Message queue
Currently work in progress.

A simple, reliable, and modern message queue built on top of PostgreSQL.

Also serves as a **real-world example of applying Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles in Go**.

## TODO
- [x] Archival of finalized messages
- [x] Message prioritization
- [x] Some kind of long-polling for consumers
- [x] Atomic Ack + Publish
- [x] Permanent nack
- [x] Batch operations
- [x] Configurable queues (config file)
- [ ] Dead-letter queues
- [ ] Add authentication (config file)
- [ ] Message forwarding
- [ ] Tries history (and attempt ID)
- [ ] Removal of old messages
- [ ] Metrics
- [ ] Implement webhooks
- [ ] Rate-limited queues
- [ ] Single-process mode
- [ ] gRPC
- [ ] ValueObjects for ~~queue name~~, priority
- [ ] Decrease priority after some time
- [ ] Distributed tracing support
- [ ] Document
- [ ] Compare with alternatives
- [ ] More benchmarks
- [ ] Create admin API and UI (most likely won't do)

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Message Prioritization** – High-priority messages are picked first.
- ✅ **Retries & Backoff** – Lost/NACKed messages are retried automatically.
- ✅ **Long-polling** – Consumers can efficiently wait until a message comes.
- ✅ **Atomic Ack + Publish** – Consumers can publish messages atomically with Ack.

## 📦 When to Use

This queue is perfect when you:

- Want infrastructure with **minimal setup**
- Need a hackable solution to implement **custom features**
- Prefer to **avoid Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.** for basic workflows

## 🚫 When *Not* to Use

- Your system processes **millions of messages per second**
